Slides served as a valuable visual aid with a strong logical sequence to presentation.","Overall, the team provided a good overview of the problem, solution, and details surrounding the case prompt. The team's slides were very compelling and well done. The solution of using AAV based platform provides a great route to the solution, but lacks creativity and differentiation from current methods being developed. The team appeared to have done a great amount of secondary research and calculations for their conclusions. However, there were no evident citations or references to where the data had come from. Additionally, the team lacked enthusiasm for their solutions and their collective demeanor did not match the quality of the slides and solution. There was also very little talk about contingency plans and the potential roadblocks of their AAV platform/partnership, though patient accessibility was covered in detail. Additionally, the timeline for their solution could have been more clear. The good better best comparison was nice, but the best option deserved a little more attention and detail. The team provided a good solution, but it could use refinement and attention to communication during presenting the data."

The team's slides were clear and understandable, and their level of enthusiasm was appropriate. The proposed solution of ASO based therapies is innovative and attention was paid and options were provided for different routes of delivery. Additionally, a contingency plan of AAV based platform was provided. However, the team failed to mention any success of ASO therapies in the market and did not address any of the recent failures and shortcomings of commercial ASO technology. Additionally, the team proposed to partner with other large pharmaceutical companies (i.e. Roche) and the rationale, timeline, details of the partnership lacked clarity. This aspect did not seem feasible or strategically realistic for a top-10 pharmaceutical company. The team's solution, though potentially impactful, still results in large patient cost and accessibility issues. The team mentioned some solutions (streamlining development/manufacturing) to drive down production cost and therefore patient cost, but did not provide actionable suggestions to this end. Overall, the team provided a very good solution to the problem, but refinement of some details and digging deeper on their ideas would have strengthened their argument. "

Additionally, the team provided a case study for recent success in partnership which gave even more merit to their choice.

The team provided good reasoning for their choice of HD and their rationale was clear. The team also provided great details by providing information not only about their delivery platform, but also what would be contained in the AAV. The team showed options and made comparisons which with current technology which was informative. However, the the slides overall were very text heavy and contained too much information to digest at one time. The slides were cluttered making it difficult to pull main points from the graphics and clouding the team's take-home messages. The proposal for partnerships did not appear feasible and lacked clarity. The team proposed to partner with institutions first, then partner with biotech companies producing HD AAVs, then partner or acquire larger biotech companies for distribution. The large number of partnerships proposed is likely unreasonable and the timeline presented of >12 years is likely to put the solution into a market that is difficult to forecast or know.

Market size and need - sources for numbers? even just a quick explanation of how you estimated these numbers would be useful. Market size should be in dollars typically.

The bar graphs for market size/competitive landscape are difficult to easily understand - highlighting what you want to focus on or having a bottom line on the slide is helpful

Similarly, wasn't fully clear why Passage Bio over other potential candidates

Overall quick explanations of how you reached assumptions/conclusions are definitely necessary to fully understand your approach and thinking

Missing location/availability of treatment as a part of accessibility (e.g. rural patients are much less likely to be close to a treatment center)

I would appreciate a quick recap at the end even with the executive summary slide at the beginning.

Strengths:
Love the scoring grid for the different focus areas.

I understand that medical/scientific language gets technical very quickly, but refining to avoid so many abbreviations would be good.

I like the color scheme and the graphs were clear. Other slides were a bit wordy, and it was difficult to focus visually on the bottom-line (e.g., the AAV vs Lentivirus slide)

I like the consideration of delivery route - it is incredibly important for patients.

Needs acknowledgment of potential risks with acquisition. Established management is not always a plus for acquisitions, where integration of management between the two companies is required.

Really appreciate the geographic limitations for equitable access, but a little more detail on addressing financial barriers (esp for uninsured patients) would be nice.

I would love to see a graph showing market sizes for all 4 diseases to better explain your recommendation.

How did you rank your competitive landscapes? How did you pick RNAi and AAV? Why partnerships over acquisitions? I'd appreciate a little more explanation to the starting points of your comparisons.

What would the timeline look like for your partnership? How many years out is this?

How do multiple types of mutations affect your treatment? 

Great list of barriers to access; adjusting costs based on financial need is an interesting take, but I'm not sure how to implement something like that. More detail please!

Slides were very straightforward. I appreciate having only one main thing to look at in each slide, but overall, I felt your solution and analyses could be more in-depth and have more research backing it up.

Justification for delivery route focus was very clear and thought-out

The partnership and/or acquisition should be more thought out. Pick what you think is the best plan and elaborate on it with justification for why you picked the one plan (e.g., partnering with academic institutions for the next X years and acquiring Apertura within Y years is the best plan for XYZ reasons --> detail the future timeline).

After picking a plan, you can then describe in more detail what the risks and next steps are for the client.

The equitable care access was well-detailed. What about the states that don't have a center of excellence?

Slides were very clear and beautifully made. Presentation style was good and all participants spoke clearly and confidently. Overall, just missing a lot more detail for the actual strategic plan. It's difficult to say how impactful or feasible the plan is without a clear single recommendation for which entities to partner with or acquire.
